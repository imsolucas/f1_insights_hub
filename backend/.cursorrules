Scope

Rules for the Node.js/Express API (backend/) and shared backend code. This is the primary backend architecture document for F1 Insight Hub.

Non‑negotiables
- No TODOs or placeholder comments. Keep modules small and testable.
- Every route validated with zod; errors normalized; logs structured.
- All external API calls (F1 data sources) must be cached and rate-limited.
⸻
1) Architecture
backend/src/
  app/              # express app bootstrap, middleware, router attach
  modules/
    races/          # controller, service, repo, schemas for race data
    drivers/        # driver statistics and profiles
    teams/          # team/constructor data
    circuits/       # circuit/track information
    insights/       # AI-generated race summaries and insights
    predictions/    # ML model predictions integration
    users/          # user preferences, saved data (if auth added)
  lib/              # http (errors, validation), logger (pino/winston), cache (redis/memory)
  routes.ts         # v1 route registration
  config/           # environment config, database connection

- Controllers (http) → Services (business) → Repos (database/external APIs). Controllers never call database or external APIs directly.
- Export shared DTO types where frontends need them.
- External F1 data sources abstracted behind service layer with caching.
⸻
2) API Style
- REST, versioned under /v1. Response envelope:
type ApiResponse<T> = { success: true; data: T; correlationId: string; timestamp: string }
type ApiError = { success: false; error: { code: string; message: string; details?: unknown }, correlationId: string; timestamp: string }

- Emit and return a correlationId per request (header X-Correlation-ID or generated).
- All timestamps in ISO 8601 format.
- Pagination: use cursor-based or offset-based consistently. Include total count when feasible.
⸻
3) Auth & Security
- If authentication added: JWT access (short‑lived) + refresh via HTTP‑Only cookies or Authorization Bearer.
- Roles: USER | ADMIN (if needed). Middleware: requireAuth(), requireRole(role).
- CORS allow‑list from env (frontend domain).
- Helmet, rate‑limit (IP+user), and WAF‑style reject for obvious probes.
- Never log PII; mask sensitive identifiers.
- API keys for external F1 data sources stored in env, never hardcoded.
⸻
4) External Data Integration
- F1 data sources (Ergast API, F1 official API, etc.) abstracted behind service layer.
- All external calls cached (Redis or in-memory with TTL). Cache keys include data type + identifier.
- Rate limiting per external API to respect their limits.
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.
- Fallback to cached data if external API fails.
- Never expose external API keys to frontend.
⸻
5) Transactions & Data Consistency
- Multi‑step operations use database transactions (Prisma transactions).
- Background jobs (data sync, cache warming) via a queue (BullMQ or simple job queue). Keep job payloads minimal; idempotent handlers.
- Race conditions handled with database locks or optimistic concurrency.
⸻
6) OpenAPI & SDK
- Generate OpenAPI from route schemas (zod → openapi). Document all endpoints.
- Publish a typed client SDK that frontends must use for API calls.
⸻
7) Errors & Logging
- Central handler maps domain errors → HTTP codes.
- Structured JSON logs: include correlationId, userId (if any), route, latency, error stack.
- Production responses never include stack traces or internal error details.
- Log levels: ERROR for failures, WARN for recoverable issues, INFO for important events, DEBUG for development.
⸻
8) Testing
- Unit: services with repo/external API mocks.
- Integration: supertest against in‑memory/real Express + test Postgres (Docker or local PostgreSQL).
- Contract tests produce example payloads and validate OpenAPI.
- Mock external F1 APIs in tests; never call real APIs in test suite.
⸻
9) CI/CD (GitHub Actions → Render/Vercel)
- Workflow (high level):
    1. npm/pnpm i --frozen-lockfile
    2. Lint, typecheck, unit/integration tests
    3. Build API
    4. Deploy to Render (or Vercel) with env from secrets
    5. Run database migrations (Prisma migrations) before deploy completes
- Health check endpoint /healthz for monitoring.
- Rollback strategy: keep previous deployment version available.
⸻
10) Code Quality
- Functions preferably < 50 LOC; pure services when possible.
- No ad‑hoc utilities in controllers—move to lib/ or modules.
- Strong typing across layers; avoid any and wide unknown without narrowing.
- Use TypeScript strict mode.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
_____
11) Database
Rules for PostgreSQL schema design, migrations, indexing, and Prisma usage.
- Table/column names: snake_case. Prisma maps to camelCase in application code.
- Primary keys: id UUID (v7/cuid2 acceptable) or serial integer.
- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at (default now(), trigger to update).
- Soft deletes only when mandated; prefer strict FKs and status transitions.
- All changes via Prisma migrations. Never edit generated migrations; create new ones.
- Numeric fields for precise calculations (e.g., lap times, points). No floats for critical data.
- Single Prisma Client per service process; enable connection pooling (Prisma connection pool or PgBouncer).
- Use prisma.$transaction for multi‑row invariants; prefer interactive transactions for read‑modify‑write.
- Select narrow columns; avoid large eager loads unless necessary.
- Separate dev seed and test seed. Never seed prod.
- Run prisma migrate deploy during deploy; if failure, block rollout.
- Status transitions enforced by DB where possible (e.g., CHECK constraints).
- Index frequently queried columns (race_id, driver_id, circuit_id, dates).
- Use Prisma middleware for multi-tenant features if needed (or implement at application level).
