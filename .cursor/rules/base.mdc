Scope

Base engineering principles and quality standards that apply across all parts of the F1 Insight Hub application (frontend, backend, ML, infrastructure).

Non‑negotiables
- Code must be explainable in interviews and code reviews.
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys; always use environment variables.
- Validate all inputs at API and component boundaries.
⸻
1) Principles

- Clarity over cleverness: prefer explicit, readable code over clever one-liners.
- Explicit over implicit: make dependencies and data flows clear.
- Maintainability over premature optimization: optimize only when profiling shows a need.
- Portfolio quality: code should demonstrate professional engineering practices.
⸻
2) Quality Bar

- Code must be understandable by a human reviewer without extensive comments.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions; prefer simple, direct solutions.
- No copy-paste boilerplate without understanding what it does.
- Functions should have single responsibility; keep them focused and testable.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
⸻
3) Security

- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration.
- Validate all inputs at boundaries (API endpoints, form submissions, external data).
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Use HTTPS in production; never transmit sensitive data over HTTP.
⸻
4) Collaboration Model

- The user is the tech lead; respect their architectural decisions.
- Explain architectural decisions briefly before implementing major changes.
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous.
- Document non-obvious decisions and trade-offs.
⸻
5) Tech Constraints

- TypeScript wherever possible; avoid JavaScript unless necessary.
- REST APIs only; no GraphQL unless explicitly requested.
- Modular architecture: separate concerns, clear boundaries between modules.
- Use established patterns and libraries; avoid reinventing the wheel.
⸻
6) Code Style

- Use consistent formatting (Prettier/ESLint).
- Meaningful variable and function names; self-documenting code preferred.
- Add comments only when logic is non-obvious (explain "why", not "what").
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 LOC when possible).
- Avoid deep nesting; prefer early returns and guard clauses.
