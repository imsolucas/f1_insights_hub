# F1 Insight Hub — Branding & UI Guidelines

This document defines the visual and interaction style of the application.
All frontend work must conform to these guidelines.

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Prediction-market meets F1**: Data-dense, odds-friendly UI (think crypto trading dashboards, Polymarket, Kalshi) with F1 identity.
- Clean, modern, data-first. Dense but scannable tables, clear probability/confidence indicators.
- Vibrant green for primary actions and positive indicators; red for negative/destructive actions. Team colors for F1-specific context.
- Minimal decoration; typography and color do the work. Consistent rounded corners throughout.

The UI should feel:
- **Professional** — like a serious trading or prediction surface.
- **Calm** — dark green-gray bases, restrained accents, no visual noise.
- **Trustworthy** — clear hierarchy, readable numbers, obvious states.
- **F1-native** — team colors and F1 context signal "this is motorsport" while maintaining modern trading dashboard aesthetics.

---

## UI Framework

- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for layout and spacing
- Radix primitives under the hood

No custom component libraries unless approved.

---

## Color System

### Base (Prediction-market feel)

- **Background**: Dark slate/zinc (`slate-950`, `zinc-950`) or very dark gray with subtle green-gray tint. Avoid pure black.
- **Surface**: Slightly lighter than background (`slate-900`, `zinc-900`) for cards, modals, dropdowns. All surfaces use consistent rounded corners.
- **Foreground**: High-contrast off-white (`slate-50`, `zinc-100`) for primary text.
- **Muted**: `slate-400` / `zinc-500` for secondary text, captions, placeholders.

Light mode optional: Use `zinc-50` / `zinc-100` backgrounds with `zinc-900` foreground if you support it.

### Primary Accents (Trading Dashboard)

- **Primary / Success Green**: Vibrant green for CTAs, active states, key metrics, "primary" actions, and positive indicators.
  - Use: `emerald-400`–`emerald-500` or equivalent HSL. This is the dominant accent color for buttons, active navigation, and positive data.
  - Ensure AA contrast on your background.
- **White**: Use for high-emphasis text on dark green/dark surfaces, or as a secondary brand accent.
- **Border / subtle**: `slate-700` / `zinc-800` on dark; `slate-200` on light.

### Status Colors (Prediction-market semantics)

- **Success / Long / Yes / Positive**: Vibrant green (`emerald-400`, `emerald-500`). Use for gains, "yes" odds, positive deltas, active states, and primary CTAs.
- **Destructive / Short / No / Negative**: Bold red (`red-500`, `rose-500`). Use for losses, "no" odds, negative deltas, and destructive actions (e.g., "Sell"). Keep it readable, not alarming.
- **Warning**: Amber (`amber-500`) for alerts, pending states, caution.
- **Neutral / Inactive**: `slate-500` for disabled or inactive states.

### Team Colors (F1 identity)

Use for driver/team context, badges, and subtle accents—not for entire layouts.

| Team        | Primary     | Use case                    |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Ferrari    | `red-600`   | Ferrari drivers, team badge |
| Mercedes   | `cyan-500`  | Mercedes drivers            |
| Red Bull   | `blue-600`  | Red Bull drivers            |
| McLaren    | `orange-500`| McLaren drivers             |
| Aston Martin | `emerald-600` | Aston Martin drivers    |
| Alpine     | `blue-400`  | Alpine drivers              |
| Williams   | `blue-500`  | Williams drivers            |
| Haas       | `white` / `gray-400` | Haas drivers       |
| Kick Sauber | `red-700` / `black` | Kick Sauber drivers |
| RB         | `blue-400`  | RB drivers                  |

- Prefer **outlined** or **muted** badges (e.g. `bg-red-600/10 text-red-400 border border-red-500/30`) so team colors don't overpower the UI.
- Use team colors in tables, driver cards, and prediction context—not for global chrome (nav, buttons) which should use vibrant green for active states.

---

## Typography

- **Primary Font**: **Poppins** (via `--font-poppins` CSS variable) for all headings, titles, and prominent text.
  - Use `style={{ fontFamily: 'var(--font-poppins)' }}` in React components.
  - Poppins is loaded with weights: 400, 600, 700, 800 (normal and italic styles).
- **Font Hierarchy**:
  - **Page titles (h1)**: `text-4xl font-extrabold uppercase tracking-wide italic` with Poppins font
    - Typically paired with F1 logo image (`h-24 w-auto`)
    - Example: "DRIVERS 2025", "TEAMS", "CIRCUITS"
  - **Section headers (h2)**: `text-2xl font-bold uppercase tracking-wide italic` with Poppins font
    - Example: "UPCOMING RACES", "RECENT RESULTS"
  - **Subsection headers (h3)**: `text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-wide italic` with Poppins font
    - Example: "DRIVERS", "TEAMS", "CIRCUITS" in navigation cards
  - **Body text**: System UI or Inter for readability. Use Poppins only for headings and titles.
- **Typography Pattern**:
  - All main page titles use: Poppins + `font-extrabold` + `italic` + `uppercase` + `tracking-wide`
  - Section headers use: Poppins + `font-bold` + `italic` + `uppercase` + `tracking-wide`
  - Driver names in cards use: Poppins + `font-extrabold` + `italic` + `uppercase`
- **Required**: Use **tabular numbers** for all odds, probabilities, lap times, prices, and any aligned numeric data in tables or data displays. This ensures consistent alignment and professional appearance.
- **F1 Logo Integration**: Main page titles should include the F1 logo image (`/f1-logo/f1-logo.svg`) positioned before the text, sized appropriately (`h-24 w-auto` for main titles, `h-16 w-auto` for detail pages, `h-8 w-auto` for header).

---

## Layout Rules

- Page-based routing with consistent header and sidebar.
- Content centered with max-width; comfortable reading length for prose.
- **Prediction-market style**: Dense but structured. Use clear grids, tables, and cards for odds, predictions, and stats.
- Generous spacing between major sections; tighter spacing within data blocks (tables, stat rows).

---

## Components

### Allowed

- Cards, Tables, Badges, Tabs, Tooltips, Skeleton loaders.
- **Odds-style blocks**: Clear "yes/no" or probability displays with success/destructive accents.
- **Team/driver badges**: Use team colors as specified above.
- All components should use **consistent rounded corners** (typically `rounded-lg` or `rounded-xl` in Tailwind).

### Required

- Loading states, empty states, error states.
- Clear **active / selected** states (e.g. vibrant green background or border accent, green underline for navigation).
- Obvious **hover** feedback on interactive elements (subtle background change or border highlight).

---

## Interaction Design

- Subtle hover effects (slight background or border change).
- No excessive animations; optional micro-motion on toggles or confident actions.
- Immediate feedback on user actions (loading, success, error).
- Fast perceived performance; skeleton loaders where appropriate.

---

## Data Visualization

- Charts must be readable; prefer clarity over decoration.
- Use **success/destructive** semantics for positive vs negative (e.g. vibrant green for positive trends/gains, bold red for negative trends/losses).
- Primary chart colors: vibrant green (`emerald-400`–`emerald-500`) for positive data, bold red (`red-500`) for negative data.
- Team colors for series that represent specific teams/drivers (use as secondary colors when needed).
- Label axes and legends clearly; support keyboard/screen readers where applicable.

---

## Accessibility

- Maintain proper contrast (WCAG AA) for all text and interactive elements.
- Keep focus rings visible and theme-aware.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA where needed for custom widgets.

---

## Clean Code

- **Readable and self-documenting**: Prefer clear names and simple logic over clever shortcuts. Code should be understandable at a glance.
- **Consistent formatting**: Use Prettier/ESLint. Follow project style for indentation, quotes, and line length.
- **No magic values**: Use design tokens, constants, or shared config for colors, spacing, and repeated strings—no hard-coded literals scattered in JSX/CSS.
- **DRY**: Extract repeated UI or logic into reusable components, hooks, or utilities. Avoid copy-paste.
- **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive names for components, props, variables, and handlers (e.g. `onRaceSelect`, `isLoadingResults`).
- **Small and focused**: Keep components and functions small and single-purpose. Split large files instead of adding more responsibilities.
- **Explicit over implicit**: Make data flow and dependencies clear. Avoid implicit behavior or "magic" that isn’t obvious from the code.
- **No TODOs or placeholders**: Don’t commit TODO comments or placeholder implementations. Resolve or remove them before merge.
- **Remove cruft**: Delete unused imports, dead code, and commented-out blocks. Keep the codebase tidy.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Do)

- Overuse of gradients or glossy effects (subtle gradients in charts are acceptable).
- Excessive shadows or "dashboard clutter."
- Generic purple/blue as primary brand color; stick to vibrant green/red and team palette.
- Hard-coded inline styles; use design tokens / Tailwind.
- Unstyled raw HTML elements.
- Sharp corners on cards/buttons; always use rounded corners for a modern, cohesive feel.

---

## Inspiration References

- **Prediction-market / Trading**: Crypto trading dashboards, Polymarket, Kalshi, Augur — data-dense, odds-focused, professional with vibrant green/red semantics.
- **Product / UI**: shadcn/ui, Linear, Vercel Dashboard — clean, modern, component-driven with rounded corners.
- **F1**: Official F1 graphics, team liveries — team colors, bold but readable.

The UI should feel like a **modern trading dashboard built for F1**: serious, data-first, vibrant green accents for success, red for negative, and unmistakably motorsport through team colors and context.
