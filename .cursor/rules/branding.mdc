# F1 Insight Hub — Branding & UI Guidelines

This document defines the visual and interaction style of the application.
All frontend work must conform to these guidelines.

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Prediction-market meets F1**: Data-dense, odds-friendly UI (think Polymarket, Kalshi) with F1 identity.
- Clean, modern, data-first. Dense but scannable tables, clear probability/confidence indicators.
- Use F1 red, white, and team colors as accents—never generic purple/blue.
- Minimal decoration; typography and color do the work.

The UI should feel:
- **Professional** — like a serious prediction or trading surface.
- **Calm** — dark bases, restrained accents, no visual noise.
- **Trustworthy** — clear hierarchy, readable numbers, obvious states.
- **F1-native** — red/white and team colors signal “this is motorsport.”

---

## UI Framework

- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for layout and spacing
- Radix primitives under the hood

No custom component libraries unless approved.

---

## Color System

### Base (Prediction-market feel)

- **Background**: Dark slate/zinc (`slate-950`, `zinc-950`) or very dark gray. Avoid pure black.
- **Surface**: Slightly lighter than background (`slate-900`, `zinc-900`) for cards, modals, dropdowns.
- **Foreground**: High-contrast off-white (`slate-50`, `zinc-100`) for primary text.
- **Muted**: `slate-400` / `zinc-500` for secondary text, captions, placeholders.

Light mode optional: Use `zinc-50` / `zinc-100` backgrounds with `zinc-900` foreground if you support it.

### Primary Accents (F1)

- **Primary / F1 Red**: Bold red for CTAs, active states, key metrics, “primary” actions.
  - Use: `red-500`–`red-600` or equivalent HSL. Ensure AA contrast on your background.
- **White**: Use for high-emphasis text on dark red/dark surfaces, or as a secondary brand accent.
- **Border / subtle**: `slate-700` / `zinc-800` on dark; `slate-200` on light.

### Status Colors (Prediction-market semantics)

- **Success / Long / Yes / Positive**: Muted green (`emerald-500`, `green-500`). Use for gains, “yes” odds, positive deltas.
- **Destructive / Short / No / Negative**: Muted red (`red-500`, `rose-500`). Use for losses, “no” odds, negative deltas. Keep it readable, not alarming.
- **Warning**: Amber (`amber-500`) for alerts, pending states, caution.
- **Neutral / Inactive**: `slate-500` for disabled or inactive states.

### Team Colors (F1 identity)

Use for driver/team context, badges, and subtle accents—not for entire layouts.

| Team        | Primary     | Use case                    |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Ferrari    | `red-600`   | Ferrari drivers, team badge |
| Mercedes   | `cyan-500`  | Mercedes drivers            |
| Red Bull   | `blue-600`  | Red Bull drivers            |
| McLaren    | `orange-500`| McLaren drivers             |
| Aston Martin | `emerald-600` | Aston Martin drivers    |
| Alpine     | `blue-400`  | Alpine drivers              |
| Williams   | `blue-500`  | Williams drivers            |
| Haas       | `white` / `gray-400` | Haas drivers       |
| Kick Sauber | `red-700` / `black` | Kick Sauber drivers |
| RB         | `blue-400`  | RB drivers                  |

- Prefer **outlined** or **muted** badges (e.g. `bg-red-600/10 text-red-400 border border-red-500/30`) so team colors don’t overpower the UI.
- Use team colors in tables, driver cards, and prediction context—not for global chrome (nav, buttons) unless it’s clearly F1-red/white.

---

## Typography

- **Font**: System UI or Inter. Optional: a compact numeric font for odds/statistics (e.g. tabular figures).
- **Hierarchy**:
  - Page titles: large, bold, high contrast.
  - Section headers: medium weight, clear spacing.
  - Body: readable size, comfortable line-height.
- Use **tabular numbers** for odds, probabilities, lap times, and any aligned numeric data.
- Avoid decorative or playful fonts.

---

## Layout Rules

- Page-based routing with consistent header and sidebar.
- Content centered with max-width; comfortable reading length for prose.
- **Prediction-market style**: Dense but structured. Use clear grids, tables, and cards for odds, predictions, and stats.
- Generous spacing between major sections; tighter spacing within data blocks (tables, stat rows).

---

## Components

### Allowed

- Cards, Tables, Badges, Tabs, Tooltips, Skeleton loaders.
- **Odds-style blocks**: Clear “yes/no” or probability displays with success/destructive accents.
- **Team/driver badges**: Use team colors as specified above.

### Required

- Loading states, empty states, error states.
- Clear **active / selected** states (e.g. F1 red underline or background tint).
- Obvious **hover** feedback on interactive elements.

---

## Interaction Design

- Subtle hover effects (slight background or border change).
- No excessive animations; optional micro-motion on toggles or confident actions.
- Immediate feedback on user actions (loading, success, error).
- Fast perceived performance; skeleton loaders where appropriate.

---

## Data Visualization

- Charts must be readable; prefer clarity over decoration.
- Use **success/destructive** semantics for positive vs negative (e.g. green up, red down).
- F1 red or team colors for series that represent specific teams/drivers.
- Label axes and legends clearly; support keyboard/screen readers where applicable.

---

## Accessibility

- Maintain proper contrast (WCAG AA) for all text and interactive elements.
- Keep focus rings visible and theme-aware.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA where needed for custom widgets.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Do Not Do)

- Overuse of gradients or glossy effects.
- Excessive shadows or “dashboard clutter.”
- Generic purple/blue as primary brand color; stick to F1 red/white and team palette.
- Hard-coded inline styles; use design tokens / Tailwind.
- Unstyled raw HTML elements.

---

## Inspiration References

- **Prediction-market**: Polymarket, Kalshi, Augur — data-dense, odds-focused, professional.
- **Product / UI**: shadcn/ui, Linear, Vercel Dashboard — clean, modern, component-driven.
- **F1**: Official F1 graphics, team liveries — red/white, team colors, bold but readable.

The UI should feel like a **prediction market built for F1**: serious, data-first, and unmistakably motorsport.
